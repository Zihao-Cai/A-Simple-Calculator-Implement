# A-Simple-Calculator-Implement
based on QT 5.14 IDE..with language of C++..using the data structure stack to implement

there is an independent exeutable file called Calculator.exe for anyone who want to use it without any QT environment
and it is a school laboratry work just for exercising the useness of stack data structure
maybe there are also many shortnesses or bugs existed and hoping for anyone to instruct or communicate
